      <h3 id="timeline">Here's a time line of Enzo Ferrari's life:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1898</span> - Enzo Ferrari was said to have been born on 18 February 1898 in Modena, Italy and that his birth was recorded on 20 February because a heavy snowstorm had prevented his father from reporting the birth at the local registry office; in reality, his birth certificate states he was born on 20 February 1898, while the birth's registration took place on 24 February 1898 and was reported by the midwife</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1916</span> - His father Alfredo, and his older brother, Alfredo Jr., died in 1916 as a result of a widespread Italian flu outbreak. Ferrari became severely sick himself in the 1918 flu pandemic and was consequently discharged from the Italian service.</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1923</span> - In 1920, Ferrari joined the racing department of Alfa Romeo as a driver. Ferrari won his first Grand Prix in 1923 in Ravenna on the Savio Circuit. 1924 was his best season, with three wins, including Ravenna, Polesine and the Coppa Acerbo in Pescara.[7] Deeply shocked by the death of Ugo Sivocci in 1923 and Antonio Ascari in 1925, Ferrari, by his own admissions, continued to race half-heartedly. At the same time, he developed a taste for the organisational aspects of Grand Prix racing.</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1929</span> - The Scuderia Ferrari Racing Team was founded by Enzo Ferrari</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1947</span> - During World War I, Baracca's mother gave Ferrari a necklace with the prancing horse on it prior to takeoff. Baracca was shot down and killed by an Austrian aeroplane in 1918.[8] In memory of his death, Ferrari used the prancing horse to create the emblem that would become the world-famous Ferrari shield. Initially displayed on Alfa Romeos, the shield was first seen on a Ferrari in 1947.</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1950</span> - In 1950 Ferrari enrolled in the newly born Drivers World Championship and is the only team to remain continuously present since its introduction. Ferrari won his first world championship Grand Prix with José Froilán González at Silverstone in 1951. The story goes that Enzo cried like a baby when his team finally defeated the mighty Alfetta 159. The first championship came in 1952, with Alberto Ascari, a task that was repeated one year later. In 1953 Ferrari made his only attempt at the Indianapolis 500. In order to finance his racing endeavours in Formula One as well as in other events such as the Mille Miglia and Le Mans, the company started selling sports cars.</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1963</span> - Ferrari had previously offered Ford the opportunity to buy the firm in 1963 for US$18 million ($152,158,696 in 2020 dollars [14]) but, late in negotiations, Ferrari withdrew once he realized that Ford would not agree to grant him independent control of the company racing department. Ferrari became a joint-stock company, and Fiat took a small share in 1965. In 1969 Fiat increased their holding to 50% of the company. In 1988 Fiat's holding rose to 90%.</p></li>
        <li><p><span id="bold">1988</span> - Ferrari died on 14 August 1988 in Maranello at the age of 90. No cause of death was given. His death was not made public until two days later, as by Enzo's request, to compensate for the late registration of his birth.[citation needed] He witnessed the launch of the Ferrari F40, shortly before his death, which was dedicated as a symbol of his achievements. In 2002 the first car to be named after him was launched as the Enzo Ferrari.</p></li>
